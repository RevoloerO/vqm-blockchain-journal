1.HelloWorld
To test the project, run "npm init" and "npm install alchemy-sdk"
1.a.HelloWorld.js
- the network will connect with Sepolia which provide fakeETH to test the program
- Need to get API_KEY from Alchemy and change it into the code 
1.b.Price-Demo.js
- Again, need to get API_KEY from Alchemy, put it into the code
- The price data do not show up as the readable way, so I need to use JSON.stringify(data) to handle and read the JSON.
