1.HelloWorld.sol
It is quite confusing when I used Remix to create 1st Solidity project, to test the file, I need to:
1. Select smart contract file
2. Compile HelloWorld.sol
3. Deploy smart contract to Remix VM
4. Interact with HelloWorld function with deployed contracts, the printed hello message stay in the decoded output.

2.Storage.sol
It is much more simple after I understand how value is sent and retrieved via blockchain
Beside, Remix VM, I also used solidity extension on Visual Studio Code to test and check value.
