To understand this contract, I need to understand the mapping function which provide search function to search for value based on key. Next, the application can listen to event via using event-emit function 
**Events - definition(Solidity events give an abstraction on top of the EVM’s logging functionality. Applications can subscribe and listen to these events through the RPC interface of an Ethereum client.Events are inheritable members of contracts. When you call them, they cause the arguments to be stored in the transaction’s log - a special data structure in the blockchain.)
